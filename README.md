# Welcome to Frontend Boi 👋

## 🚀 About Me

```java
public class Developer {
    String name = "Aditya";
    int age = 17;
    String location = "India 🇮🇳";
    String dreamDestination = "Poland 🇵🇱";
    String status = "Self-taught & Job-hunting (when I turn 18)";
    boolean lovesStronglyTypedLanguages = true;
    
    public String getCurrentFocus() {
        return "Mastering Java & Building Backend Skills";
    }
}
```

I'm a self-taught developer who started coding because I wanted to build things that matter. Currently diving deep into Java and preparing for my first professional role. I believe in strongly typed languages, clean code, and the power of persistence.

**Fun fact:** Started with frontend, realized I love backend more. CSS and I have a complicated relationship 😅
