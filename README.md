🚀 2026 Professional Roadmap

I am currently following a structured path to becoming an Industry-Ready Backend Developer. My focus is on the Spring Boot ecosystem, which is the backbone of the Polish IT sector (Finance, E-commerce, and Enterprise).

Currently Mastering:

Java Core & DSA: Deep-diving into Multithreading, Streams API, and Collections. Solving daily problems on LeetCode to sharpen algorithmic thinking.

Persistent Storage: Learning PostgreSQL and relational database design.

Next Milestones:

Spring Boot Framework: Building RESTful APIs with Dependency Injection and IoC.

JPA & Hibernate: Mastering Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for efficient database communication.

Security & Auth: Implementing stateless authentication using JWT and Spring Security.

DevOps Basics: Exploring Docker containerization for Java applications.
