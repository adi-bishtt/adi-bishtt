## 🚀 About Me

```java
public class FuturePolishDev {
    private final int currentAge = 17;
    private final String target = "Poland 🇵🇱"; // No degree? No problem.
    private final String hobby = "Volleyball & Chess ♟️🏐";

    public String getStrategy() {
        return "Grinding Java until 18 to leverage Poland's skill-based visas ";
    }
}
```

I'm a self-taught developer who started coding because I wanted to build things that matter. Currently diving deep into Java and preparing for my first professional role. I believe in strongly typed languages, clean code, and the power of persistence.

**Fun fact:** Started with frontend, realized I love backend more. CSS and I have a complicated relationship 😅
