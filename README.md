# Welcome to Frontend Boi 👋

## 🚀 About Me

```java
public class Developer {
    private final String name = "Aditya";
    int age = 17; 
    boolean isHirable = (age >= 18); // Calculating the countdown to Poland 🇵🇱
    private final String location = "India 🇮🇳";
    private String goal = "Java Dev in Poland 🇵🇱"; // Visa-friendly & Volleyball-ready
    
    public String getStatus() {
        return "Self-taught & building backend mastery until I turn 18.";
    }
}
```

I'm a self-taught developer who started coding because I wanted to build things that matter. Currently diving deep into Java and preparing for my first professional role. I believe in strongly typed languages, clean code, and the power of persistence.

**Fun fact:** Started with frontend, realized I love backend more. CSS and I have a complicated relationship 😅
